# Scripto - A lazy bash scripting library for everyone

## Overview

I started writing this project since the first time I learned about bash scripting in 2020. It's actually a really cool scripting language to me!
I learned a lot from open source community and that is the reason I want to give back something to this community.

I will try to document how this source code works in my free time soon.

For people who want to learn about Bash scripting, I hope you will find some interesting and useful code snippets from my project.
